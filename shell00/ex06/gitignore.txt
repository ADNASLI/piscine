git ignore is used to ignore some files you don't want to commit ever like .DS_Store for example

You can setup this ignoref file in you git reposetory in .git/info/exclude for example or create a .gitignore file in the reposetory and what you want to exclude
You will not see those files appears whent you use git status or else

The command is that follows

git ls-files --ignored --exclude-standard --others

ls-files is the command to list the files

--ignored => to show the ignored files

--exclude-standard => Add the standard Git exclusions: .git/info/exclude, .gitignore in each directory, and the userâ€™s global exclusion file.

--others => --exclude-standard needs to add something and others shows the ignore by default
